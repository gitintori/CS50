            <p class="text">Working as a developer since 2022, i keep studying everything I can. Coding is my passion and working in this field feels like playing a game. This site is for Problem Set 8 of CS50. I absolutely love these classes, the fun way they teach things, cause that's how I see it. I've always been the funny kid at school, always making jokes and wanting to make people laugh. For me, everything should be fun and enjoyable, and I do everything I can to keep my work playful for me and everybody working with me! That way, I can achieve my results faster, easier and more effectively.</p>
